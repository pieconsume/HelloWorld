//unistd.h could be included instead but this lets you easily view function prototypes you use
extern "C" int write(int fd, const char* buffer, int count);

//You don't need to define command line arguments if you aren't going to use them

 write(1, "hello!\n", 7);
 //It's not necessary to include a return value for main(), the compiler will handle that for you
